## Approach

The Pokémon Explorer App was built using React and Next.js, leveraging the PokeAPI to fetch Pokémon data. The app consists of multiple components organized for optimal functionality:

- Home Page: Displays a list of Pokémon with pagination. The user can search the Pokémon by names
- Pokémon Detail Modal: Shows detailed information about a selected Pokémon, including its abilities and stats.

### Key features include:

- Pagination: Built using limit and offset parameters to control how many Pokémon are displayed at a time.

- Mobile-Friendly Design: Fully responsive and optimized to look great on screens of all sizes.
